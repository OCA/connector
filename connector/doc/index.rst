This is a framework to build connectors between OpenERP and external
systems or services.

OpenERP Connector has been developed by Camptocamp_ and is maintained
by Camptocamp_, Akretion_ and several contributors.

The `source is on launchpad`_.

This connector is designed to have a strong and efficient core, with the
ability to extend it with extension modules for new features or customizations.
