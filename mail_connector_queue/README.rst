This module uses the Connector Queue to send any emails generated by Odoo,
by creating a queue job for each one. This allows the user to define different
priorities for these emails, enabling, for instance, running high volume mass
mailing with low priority, to avoid blocking regular notifications.

Usage
=====

A queue job is created automatically when a new ``mail.mail`` record is
created in the ``outgoing`` state. A priority may be defined in the
``mail.mail`` record, which will be used as the job priority.

Changelog
=========

8.0.1.0.1 (2018-05-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Priority field renamed to ``mail_job_priority``
* Priority can now be passed using the context
