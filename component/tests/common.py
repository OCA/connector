    This test case is meant to test components in a special component registry,
    where you want to have maximum control on which components are loaded
    or not, or when you want to create additional components in your tests.

    If you only want to *use* the components of the tested addon in your tests,
    then consider using one of:

    * :class:`TransactionComponentCase`
    * :class:`SavepointComponentCase`

    This test case creates a special
    :class:`odoo.addons.component.core.ComponentRegistry` for the purpose of
    the tests. By default, it loads all the components of the dependencies, but
    not the components of the current addon (which you have to handle
    manually). In your tests, you can add more components in 2 manners.

    All the components of an Odoo module::

        self._load_module_components('connector')

    Only specific components::

        self._build_components(MyComponent1, MyComponent2)

    Note: for the lookups of the components, the default component
    registry is a global registry for the database. Here, you will
    need to explicitly pass ``self.comp_registry`` in the
    :class:`~odoo.addons.component.core.WorkContext`::

        work = WorkContext(model_name='res.users',
                           collection='my.collection',
                           components_registry=self.comp_registry)

    Or::

        collection_record = self.env['my.collection'].browse(1)
        with collection_record.work_on(
                'res.partner',
