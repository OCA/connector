OpenERP Connector
#################

This is a framework to build connectors between OpenERP and external
systems or services.

OpenERP Connector is mainly developed by the Magentoerpconnect Core
Editors, these being Camptocamp_ and Akretion_. The `source is on
launchpad`_.

This connector is designed to have a strong and efficient core, with the
ability to extend it with extension modules or local customizations.
