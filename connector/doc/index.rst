OpenERP Connector
#################

OpenERP Connector is a powerful and generic framework to develop any kind of
bi-directional connector between OpenERP (Open Source ERP) and any other
software or service. It is installed as a normal addons in OpenERP.

It is designed to have a modular and generic core, with the ability to be
extended with additional modules for new features or customizations.

The development of OpenERP Connector has been started by `Camptocamp`_ and is now
maintained by `Camptocamp`_, `Akretion`_ and several :ref:`contributors`.

Core Features
=============

* **100% Open Source** (`AGPL version 3`_): the full `source code is available
  on Launchpad`_
* Not only designed to connect OpenERP with e-commerce backends,
  rather it is **adaptable** to connect OpenERP with any type of service.
* **Robust for high volumetries** and **easy to monitor** thanks to a :ref:`jobs-queue`.
* A flexible set of building blocks, it does not force to a certain
  implementation but leaves the final choice to the
  developer on how to use the proposed pieces.
* See a :ref:`code-overview` with examples of code
